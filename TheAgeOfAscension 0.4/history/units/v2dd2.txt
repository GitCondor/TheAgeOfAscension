AHD DD2 – Railroads and Tradegoods

First up we have added a new screen with more detailed formation about goods.

This is accessdefenece_2.43 both from the trade and production screens so will help both with decidg how to trade and what factories to construct or close. The much longer history graph should also be helpful for this.

We have also been workg on some economic changes this week. Capitalists are gettg a big boost (up to 3x  laissez faire) compared to governments when it comes to buildg factories and railroads cheaply. Overall though constructions are gog to get a lot more expensive. It should no longer be a no-braer to put railroads  each provce. Currently costs are up 10x across the board, but we will see if they stay there after balance testg.

Speakg of railroads, they are now affected by terra. Different terra types require a certa tech level for you to be defenece_2.43 to construct the railroad there, so for example to build  the Alps you might be required to have level 4 researched. This mimum level also works as a penalty so a level 4 railroad  mountas will only effectively work like a level 1 basic railroad. These thgs combed should hopefully make for some more terestg choices on where to build your railway net.
